1. 
2. Q2 (10 points) Try at least two different “schedules” for the step size for perceptron (having one be the
constant schedule is fine). One common one is to decrease the step size by some factor every epoch or few;
another is to decrease it by 1
t
. How do the results change?

t th epoch I am referring to in this explanation is according to traditional counting. So, 2nd epoch means 2nd iteration with index 1 at my code (the code iterates through (0, epochs)), not 3rd iteration.
The first schedule I tried was starting at 1.3 and decreasing by 0.3 every 4 epochs starting from second epoch. (15 epochs total, so decrease would happen at 2, 6, 10, 14 epochs)
This results in train accuracy of 0.98 and dev accuracy of 0.73 - 0.75. Dev accuracy of between 0.74 and 0.75 was majority. 
The second schedule I tried was starting at 1 and decreasing the step size by 1/t every 4 epochs starting from the second epoch. (15 epochs total, so decrease would happen at 2, 6, 10, 14 epochs)
This results in train accuracy of 0.97 - 0.98 and dev accuracy of 0.73 - 0.75. Dev accuracy of between 0.73 and 0.74 was majority.
Both schedules have similar train accuracy, with the second being slightly lower. 
The second schedule of decreasing step size by 1/t generally had a lower dev accuracy of around 0.73 - 0.74 while the first schedule generally had 0.74 - 0.75.
